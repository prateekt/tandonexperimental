This looks really good. Great job. My only comments are:

1) The other editors will probably say it is 30% - 50% too long.

2) I think you should include some related work about other similar
projects/organizations, and list why you are different -- i.e., because
you serve a unique community with very specific needs.


3) I'm not sure how the other editors will feel about so much of the
article being in first person. It reads as a personal account, which I
think is good, but others may have a problem with. Perhaps tone it down
a little.

4) It might be a little too... what's the best word... advertising,
maybe aggrandizing? I agree that it is a great project for a great
cause, but see 5). Maybe just tone it down a little.


5) Sentences like "What a few lines of code can do to improve the lives
of so many people is truly amazing." and "I first had the privilege of
hearing about Project Possibility" seem a little over the top to me.

6) You will definitely have to format it according to these guidelines
before submission:
http://www.acm.org/crossroads/doc/information/writing.html, with the
template available here:
http://oldwww.acm.org/crossroads/submit/ArticleTemplate.zip.

7) You will need to add some references. These should at least be the
websites you mention in the text, as well as those in 2).

You can/should take or leave any/all of my suggestions above (1-5), but
do 5 and 6 and then submit it according to this page:

http://oldwww.acm.org/crossroads/submit/

Again, I think the writing, for the most part, is excellent. Very nice job.

Let me know if you have any questions,
