The pirates view your putting the sword into the ground in awe and respect. Interestingly (and perhaps randomly), in this pirate culture there had been a prophecy that a stranger from an unknown land would just do that. Lucky for you. They call a chariot to take you to their pirate city and tell you great riches await. However, first you need to pass a test. They take you to a room with a table. On the table are two cups and you are told one is poison and one is okay. The prophecy said that the stranger would know the correct cup. Illustrate what you do.
Reach for the Left Cup, Reach for the Right Cup, Chuck the Right Cup
